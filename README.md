# CSC240-JavaScript-Week-6

In this project you will program the actions of a sign-up form in which users must supply a

user name, email address, and password for a new account. Passwords must be at least eight characters long and contain at least one letter and one number. As a validation test, the password must be entered twice to confirm that the user did not inadvertently mistype the password. If the password does not match the required pattern or if the two passwords are not identical, the password field should be flagged as invalid.
